 * Base naming rule:
 * The stuff start with "_" means private , end with "_" means protect ,

 *
 * All the member field should be private.
 *
 * Life cycle: (It's very important to know when we bind the event)
 * A widget will do this by order :
 * 1. $init
 * 2. set attributes (setters)
 * 3. rendering mold (@see mold/accordion.js )
 * 4. call bind_ to bind the event to dom .
 *
 * this.deskop will be assigned after super bind_ is called,
 * so we use it to determine whether we need to update view
 * manually in setter or not.
 * If this.desktop exist , means it's after mold rendering.
